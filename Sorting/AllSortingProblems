## Approach Guide: Sorting Problems in Data Structures & Algorithms

Below, you‚Äôll find **problem-solving strategies** for each type of sorting problem, organized by difficulty. These are language-independent conceptual approaches you can apply before translating into code.

### üî∞ Basic Sorting Problems

- **Sort an Array of Integers**  
  Decide on a simple algorithm (e.g., Bubble, Selection, or Insertion Sort). Repeatedly compare and reposition elements until the array is ordered.

- **Sort an Array in Descending Order**  
  Apply a basic sorting algorithm but swap elements to place larger values earlier. Alternatively, sort in ascending order, then reverse the array.

- **Check if an Array is Sorted**  
  Traverse the array once, checking that each element is less than or equal to the next (or greater than or equal for descending order).

- **Count Swaps in Bubble Sort**  
  Perform Bubble Sort while maintaining a count of each swap made between adjacent elements.

- **Find Second Largest/Smallest Element with Sorting**  
  Sort the array, then pick the second element from the appropriate end, skipping duplicates if needed.

- **Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array**  
  Traverse, and each time a new value is encountered, shift it to the next available distinct position.

- **Sort Array of 0s and 1s**  
  Count the number of 0s, fill that many 0s in the array, and then the rest with 1s. Alternate: Two-pointer swap approach.

- **Sort Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s (Dutch National Flag Problem)**  
  Use three pointers to partition the array into three sections for 0s, 1s, and 2s in a single scan.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Intermediate Sorting Problems

- **Sort Array using Merge or Quick Sort**  
  Apply a divide-and-conquer strategy: recursively break the array into smaller parts, sort and merge.

- **Find Kth Largest/Smallest Element**  
  Sort the array, then select the $$ K $$th element from the appropriate end. Advanced: QuickSelect algorithm.

- **Sort Characters of a String**  
  Treat the string as an array and sort using any sorting method, or by counting occurrences if limited to alphabets.

- **Sort Array of Strings by Length**  
  Sort strings where the comparison is based on string length rather than lexicographic order.

- **Count Inversions in an Array**  
  Use a modified Merge Sort to count pairs where a larger element precedes a smaller one.

- **Sort Array with Elements at Most k Away**  
  Use a min-heap of size $$ k+1 $$ for efficient ordering as you scan.

- **Find Pairs/Triplets with Given Sum (using Sorting)**  
  Sort the array, then for pairs/triplets, use two or three pointers to efficiently check sums.

- **Find Median of Unsorted Array**  
  Sort the array and pick the middle element (or average of two middles, if even).

- **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**  
  Merge by repeatedly picking the smallest current element from either array, similar to Merge Sort merge step.

- **Merge Overlapping Intervals**  
  Sort intervals by starting point, then iterate, merging intervals that overlap.

### üß† Advanced Sorting & Applications

- **Radix/Bucket/Counting Sort Implementation**  
  Use digit/character positions or value ranges to distribute and collect items without direct comparison.

- **Find Minimum Difference between Elements**  
  Sort the array, then find the smallest difference between consecutive elements.

- **Sort Linked List using Merge Sort**  
  Split the list recursively, merge sorted sublists efficiently.

- **Form Largest Number from Array (Sort as Strings)**  
  Define a custom comparison: concatenate pairs and decide order based on which concatenation forms a larger number.

- **Relative Sorting (Based on Another Array)**  
  Sort elements so those present in a reference array appear in the same order; others sorted as required.

- **Sort Matrix Row-wise and Column-wise**  
  Sort each row, then transpose and sort each row again.

- **Find Closest Pair from Two Sorted Arrays**  
  Use two pointers moving through both arrays to track the minimal absolute difference.

- **Sort Nearly Sorted Array (k-sorted)**  
  As earlier, use a heap of size $$ k+1 $$ for efficient replacement and extraction.

- **Sort People by Height (Object Sort using Comparator)**  
  Define a comparison logic for person objects based on the height (or other attributes).

- **Sort Stack using Recursion**  
  Recursively pop items, insert each back in sorted order.

- **Minimum Platforms for Trains (Sort by Arrival/Departure)**  
  Sort arrival and departure times separately, iterate to track platforms needed as trains arrive/depart.

- **Sort Array using Heap (Heap Sort)**  
  Build a max-heap, repeatedly extract the maximum to place at the correct position.

- **Find Minimum Difference after Sorting**  
  Same as minimum difference above; find the smallest difference between consecutive sorted values.

### üéØ Real-World Pattern Based Sorting Problems

- **Merge Intervals**  
  As earlier, sort by start time, merge overlaps in a single pass.

- **Meeting Rooms I & II**  
  Sort intervals by start time, then track the minimum number of rooms by comparing overlapping times.

- **Top K Frequent Elements**  
  Count frequencies, use a heap or sort by frequency, then return top $$ K $$.

- **Largest Number**  
  As above, sort elements as strings by a custom comparator.

- **Sort Colors (Dutch Flag)**  
  Partition array into three types using three pointers.

- **Minimum Arrows to Burst Balloons**  
  Sort intervals, then use greedy selection to minimize overlap coverage.

- **Reorder Data in Log Files**  
  Distinguish between letter-logs and digit-logs, sort letter-logs lexicographically, keep digit-logs in order.

- **Reconstruct Queue by Height**  
  Sort people by height descending, position them by their 'in front' count.

- **Group Anagrams**  
  Sort the characters in each word, group words with identical sorted forms.

- **Sort Array by Parity**  
  Arrange even and odd numbers, possibly using two pointers or by collecting separately, then combining.

These approaches serve as blueprints. For each problem, first analyze complexity and constraints, then decide the most efficient strategy before coding.
